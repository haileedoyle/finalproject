### Challenges

Every bug imaginable seemed to appear for my final project, after not having many issues throughout the program. 
This is definitely a work in progress, but I'm happy with the styling - for the most part - and I know that it's close to where I'd like it to be, and where my partner would like it to be as well. 

### Stretch Goals

- Book appointments through app
- Functioning Contact Form
- Toggle Forms if Admin is logged in / logged out
